# Orion HealthCloud Security Operations Simulation

A realistic enterprise cybersecurity operations simulation for Orion HealthCloud Systems, a multi-tenant healthcare SaaS and cloud infrastructure provider.

This project models real-world security monitoring, investigation, incident response, and governance decision-making within a regulated healthcare cloud environment. Weekly scenarios simulate evolving threats, operational pressures, and compliance obligations affecting a production-scale organization.

The objective is to demonstrate practical cybersecurity operations, structured investigative methodology, and integration of technical response with governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) considerations.

## Organization Overview

Orion HealthCloud Systems provides cloud hosting, data processing, and application infrastructure to hospitals, outpatient clinics, and telehealth providers. The platform stores and processes Protected Health Information (PHI) across a multi-tenant architecture.

Because Orion operates as a healthcare business associate, security incidents may impact multiple organizations simultaneously and trigger regulatory, contractual, and operational consequences.

Primary Characteristics:
- Multi-tenant healthcare SaaS platform
- Production workloads hosted in cloud environments
- Sensitive clinical and financial data processing
- Regulatory compliance requirements (HIPAA, HITECH, SOC 2)
- Continuous security monitoring and incident response operations

---

## Simulation Objectives

This repository demonstrates the following professional capabilities:

- Security alert triage and validation
- Threat investigation and evidence analysis
- Cloud security incident response
- Risk and impact assessment
- Regulatory and compliance considerations
- Executive and operational communication
- Documentation of investigative methodology
- Structured post-incident learning and improvement

Each scenario reflects realistic organizational constraints, imperfect visibility, and evolving threat conditions.

## Simulation Structure

Security events are investigated in weekly operational cycles. Each week represents a new signal, anomaly, or incident affecting the Orion HealthCloud environment.

Each case file follows a standardized structure:

Week XX/
├── 00_summary
├── 01_evidence
├── 02_analysis
├── 03_actions
├── 04_comms
└── 05_lessons


This format mirrors professional incident documentation practices and ensures consistent analytical workflow.

## Security Maturity Model

Orion HealthCloud operates at a **Developing Security Maturity Level** characterized by:

- Established monitoring capability
- Documented but inconsistently tested response procedures
- Partial cloud visibility
- Uneven policy enforcement
- Active but resource-constrained security teams

This maturity level reflects typical real-world organizational conditions and supports realistic investigative complexity.

---

## Example Scenario Types

Incidents simulated in this environment may include:

- Suspicious authentication activity
- Cloud misconfiguration exposure
- Service account compromise
- Data access anomalies
- Vendor integration risk events
- Ransomware propagation indicators
- Regulatory audit triggers
- Multi-tenant impact investigations

Scenarios evolve over time to reflect adversary behavior, operational decisions, and organizational growth.
